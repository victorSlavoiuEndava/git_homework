VCS - version control system

There are multiple types of VCS:

    1. Centralized version control
    2. Distributed version control

Benefits of GIT:

    1. Efficient performance
    2. Branching & merging
    3. Free & open source
    4. Staging area
    5. Cross-platform
    6. Security

What is a branch?
In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository,
Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch

        Main commands:

            - GIT BRANCH <NAME> creates the branch
            - GIT CHECKOUT <NAME> switching between branches
            - GIT CHECKOUT -B <BRANCHNAME> combined


Tips:
- Commit as soon as you have a working piece of code
- think what you commit
- never use force push on master
- make meaningful commit messages
- keep up to date
- use branches and suggestive names
- think on workflow and branching strategy
- search about GIT and it's possibilities
- DO NOT PANIC

What is Merge Conflict
- Conflicts generally arise when two people have changed the same lines in a file,
or if one developer deleted a file while another developer was modifying it.

How to solve Conflicts?
1. Identify the problem
2. Solve it by choosing the correct piece of code to save (Discuss with the author of conflicting code)
3. Commit changes


may the force be with us

Update:

 - after struggling with the pull requests (not having the ability to merge) I have finally succeeded.
 - had problems with the GitHub account (had multiple repositories saved from previous project) - sorted everything and now works ok
 - still have some voids to fill, to better understand some things
 - automation is a whole new world and so many things to explore/do
